# Face

This repository creates a face map similar to the image on the righthandside below. It uses the Vision and AVFoundation frameworks as well as Delaunay Triangulation. AVFoundation is used to create a sample buffer, the vision framework detects the face landmark's from the user's front camera, then the points from the face landmarks are triangulated.
